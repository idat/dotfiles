# IMPORTANT: Version Update Rule
# =============================
# Every time newsetup.se is modified, the SCRIPT_VERSION must be incremented:
# - First number (1): Major version - breaking changes
# - Second number (0): Minor version - new features
# - Third number (4): Patch version - bug fixes and improvements
# Example: After fixing a bug, increment the last number: 1.0.3 -> 1.0.4
